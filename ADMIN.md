# Admin editor (`/keystatic`) behind Cloudflare Access

The admin is [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com) in GitHub mode. Saving a post commits to this repo's
default branch, and Workers Builds deploys it. **Cloudflare Access** (Zero Trust) controls who can reach
`/keystatic` at all. The Worker also verifies the Access login itself (`src/middleware.ts`) and returns
403 for the admin routes if Access is not configured, so the admin is closed until you finish this setup.

## 1. Create the GitHub App (one time, on your machine)

1. In `.env` set `PUBLIC_KEYSTATIC_STORAGE=github`, then run `npm run dev`.
2. Open <http://127.0.0.1:4321/keystatic> and follow "Create GitHub App". Sign in as the repo owner
   (`sumankondla-88`). Keystatic writes the four values below into `.env`.
3. In GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → your app:
   - Add the callback URL `https://sumankondla.com/api/keystatic/github/oauth/callback`.
   - Install the app on `sumankondla-blog` only.
4. Remove `PUBLIC_KEYSTATIC_STORAGE` from `.env` to go back to local file editing.

## 2. Worker configuration (Cloudflare dashboard)

Workers & Pages → your Worker → Settings:

| Where | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Variables and Secrets (secret) | `KEYSTATIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | from `.env` |
| Variables and Secrets (secret) | `KEYSTATIC_SECRET` | from `.env` |
| Variables and Secrets (text) | `KEYSTATIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | from `.env` |
| Variables and Secrets (text) | `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` | `<your-team>.cloudflareaccess.com` |
| Variables and Secrets (text) | `CF_ACCESS_AUD` | AUD tag from step 3 |
| Builds → Variables and secrets | `PUBLIC_KEYSTATIC_GITHUB_APP_SLUG` | the app's slug (inlined at build time) |

## 3. Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust dashboard)

1. **Settings → Authentication → Login methods**: add one (One-time PIN needs no identity provider;
   Google or GitHub also work).
2. **Access → Applications → Add an application → Self-hosted**:
   - Session duration: 24 hours.
   - Destinations (same app): `sumankondla.com` with paths `keystatic*` and `api/keystatic*`. Optionally
     add `plan*` to protect the internal editorial plan. Add the same paths on your `*.workers.dev`
     hostname as well.
   - Policy: **Allow** → Include → **Emails** → your address only.
3. Open the application's overview and copy the **Application Audience (AUD) Tag** into `CF_ACCESS_AUD`.
   Your team domain is shown under Settings → Custom pages (or the Zero Trust URL).
4. Redeploy, then visit `https://sumankondla.com/keystatic`. You should get the Access login, then
   Keystatic's own GitHub sign-in the first time.

## Notes

- Posts stay `.md`. The editor parses the body as MDX, so avoid raw HTML tags and `import` lines in posts.
- `patches/@keystatic+core+*.patch` (applied on `npm install`) stops Keystatic from truncating code-fence
  titles that contain spaces, such as `title="wp-config.php (step 1)"`. Keep it when upgrading Keystatic.
- Cover images upload to `public/images/covers/`. A post with no cover set falls back to
  `/images/covers/<slug>.jpg` if that file exists.
